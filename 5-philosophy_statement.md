title: Philosophy Statement
---

I believe that science and engineering can be used to empower people and make the world a better place. Knowledge is a key component to making good decisions, and a STEM background helps to base these decisions on data and fundamental physical principles. By using this information, one can create new technology and use it to solve different problems in areas not only limited to engineering itself, but that also expand to politics, environmental science, law, and social sciences. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to explore their interest areas and learn the tools necessary to achieve their goals.  

An important aspect to contribute to the above statement is to create a learning environment based on respect and equal opportunities for the students. I am contributing to this environment inside the Aerospace Department at the University of Michigan, by working as the Academic Chair of Sigma Gamma Tau Honor Society. As part of this position, I helped to connect students needing help in classes with students willing to provide tutoring. This semester, I organized four research seminars to help students learn about different areas of aerospace engineering as an attempt to help them find the subjects they are passionate about. When the seminar topic is relevant to other areas, I invite undergraduate students from these departments, such as Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Additionally, I helped the Center for Engineering Diversity and Outreach (CEDO) by mentoring a first-year engineering student on academic planning, class advising, and academic-social time balance.

In the future, I plan to start a STEM startup and create a foundation for STEM diversity in my home country Brazil. In Brazil, the academic plan for middle and high school is 15 subjects, and currently, there is no support for computer science and hands-on engineering classes. The goal of this foundation is to complement the middle and high school curriculum by teaching programming fundamentals (“hello world”, data structures, and algorithms) and providing project-based engineering opportunities to students. This foundation will contribute to the share engineering knowledge across the country and empower students to find their passion and pursue their goals.  

Providing people opportunities to explore and learn about STEM fields is an effective approach to better education in any part of the world. I believe that my current and future contributions will bring me closer to making an impact in empowering people through STEM. I am using my current engineering education to explore different areas in Aerospace and Computer Engineering and, it has been three years of multiple classes, project team, and research experience to finally start understanding where my passions are and how I can use them to contribute to society. I am grateful for this opportunity at the University of Michigan, and I believe that if this was extended to more people, especially in areas of the world that are still not engaged in STEM, we could find creative and multi-disciplinary solutions to complex problems we face today and will face in the future.
