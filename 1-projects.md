Below are some projects I have made at the University of Michigan. My academics interests include:
- Formal Verification
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Theory of Differential Equations



## Rocket Fins

As aerodynamic and software engineer at [Michigan Aeronautical Science Association](https://masa.engin.umich.edu/), I am working on designing and testing the rocket fins for Tangerine Space Machine. 

Rocket fins are aerodynamic structures intended to provide stability during flight and assure that the rocket goes straight up. During the design process, several factors must be taken into account:

- Aerodynamic effects of fin shape
- Stiffness of strcture to prevent flutter
- Structural material to sustain temperatures and stress during flight
- Structrural mass

I have worked with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate stress at hypersonic conditions and Structural simulations to identify the deformation in the Fins due to aerodynamic stresses. A complex project was merging both Fluid and Structural simulations in a Two-Way Fluid Structure Interface to investigate in-flight oscillations to optimize design agains the "flutter condition", unstable oscillations that result in structural failure.

## Formal Verification

I work with formal verification of hybrid systems in the Verified Aerospace Systems Laboratory at the University of Michigan. Currently adding verification capability to the synchronous language [Zelus](https://zelus.di.ens.fr/).

## F-330 Drone Modification

As a tem project at the Center for Socially Engaged design I build a F-330 drone and modified it by attaching 3D printed multispectral sensor to test drone flight stability. I developed leadership skills by organizing the project schedule and deadlines, defining the project goals and delgeating tasks. I learned about additive manufacturing, machining processes, 3D modeling and social research.

## Remote Sensing

Undergraduate reserach experience at the Environmental Spatial Analysis laboratory. The research included analyzing satellite imagery from Puerto Rican farms to indentify Hurricane Maria's impact on the island economy. Check some of the work at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jlvargasme/prhurricane).

This project was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program ([UROP](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop)) and it received the Blue Ribbon Award in the UROP Academic Symposium Winter 2020.
