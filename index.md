  <p align="justify"> I am a 19 year-old student from Manaus, Brazil, a big city in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. As a sophomore double-majoring in Aerospace and Computer Engineering, I am curious about how technology can help to improve life on Earth and beyond.  During my time at the University of Michigan, I am getting involved with research to develop safer systems for aerospace vehicles and, to create faster algorithms for analysis of fluid interactions with spacecrafts. I am incoming interns at Amazon Web Services during the Summer, 2021. Passionate about culture and languages, I have studied abroad in Japan and live, virtually, in the Max Kade Haus, a German-speaking community at the University of Michigan.
