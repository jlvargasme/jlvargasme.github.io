  <p align="justify"> I am a 20 year-old student from Manaus, Brazil, a big city in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. As a junior double-majoring in Aerospace and Computer Engineering, I am curious about how technology can help to improve life on Earth and beyond. During my time at the University of Michigan, I am implementing a verified type system to develop safe aerospace systems software. Outside classes, I am involved at MASA, currently working as an Avionics engineer developing the rocket to ground radio communication system for the flight computer. As a software engineer at Amazon Web Services, I created a metric system to monitor application health and tcp/udp connection resets. Passionate about culture and languages, I have studied abroad in Japan and lived, virtually, in the Max Kade Haus, a German-speaking community at the University of Michigan.
