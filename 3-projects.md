A little bit about my experience as an engineer student.

## Rocket Fins

As aerodynamic and software engineer at [Michigan Aeronautical Science Association](https://masa.engin.umich.edu/), I am working on designing and testing the rocket fins for Tangerine Space Machine. 

Rocket fins are aerodynamic structures intended to provide stability during flight and assure that the rocket goes straight up. During the design process, several factors must be taken into account:

- Aerodynamic effects of fin shape
- Stiffness of strcture to prevent flutter
- Structural material to sustain temperatures and stress during flight
- Structrural mass

I have worked with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate stress at hypersonic conditions and Structural simulations to identify the deformation in the Fins due to aerodynamic stresses. A complex project was merging both Fluid and Structural simulations in a Two-Way Fluid Structure Interface to investigate in-flight oscillations to optimize design agains the "flutter condition", unstable oscillations that result in structural failure.

## Formal Verification

I work with formal verification of hybrid systems in the Verified Aerospace Systems Laboratory at the University of Michigan. Currently adding verification capability to the synchronous language [Zelus](https://zelus.di.ens.fr/).
## Languages

I am passionate about languages and cultures.

### Japanese

Homestay in Fukuoka and Wahaha Japanese School 2018.

### German

Max Kade Residential Community at the University of Michigan.

### Portuguese

Native Portuguese speaker from Brazil.

### Spanish

High School Spanish Classes.

### Chinese

Self-studying Chinese via Duolingo.

## F-330 Drone Modification

Build a F-330 drone and added 3D printed conceptual multispectral sensors to test flight stability. 

## Remote Sensing

Undergraduate reserach experience at the Environmental Spatial Analysis laboratory. The research included analyzing satellite imagery from Puerto Rican farms to indentify Hurricane Maria's impact on the island economy. Check some of the work at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jlvargasme/prhurricane).

This project was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program ([UROP](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop)) and it received the Blue Ribbon Award in the UROP Academic Symposium Winter 2020.
